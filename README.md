## Topic : Sparse Principal Component Analysis
### Authors: Hui Zou, Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani
Principal component analysis (PCA) is widely used in data processing and dimensionality reduction. However, PCA suffers from the fact that each principal component is a linear
combination of all the original variables, thus it is often difficult to interpret the results. We introduce a new method called sparse principal component analysis (SPCA) using the lasso
(elastic net) to produce modified principal components with sparse loadings.
